If you want to test code against the current date, you're likely to have to mock the JavaScript [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) object.

There are two ways to mock the Date object constructor:

- using `setSystemTime` (starting with Jest 26 and above)
- using `spyOn` (before Jest 26)

## Method 1: setSystemTime

Since Jest 26 you can use Jest [`setSystemTime`](https://jestjs.io/docs/jest-object#jestsetsystemtimenow-number--date) to simulate a user changing the system clock while your program is running.

Note that this method works with the [new modern fake timer](https://jestjs.io/blog/2020/05/05/jest-26#new-fake-timers), hence we make use of it, before setting the mock.

To clear the mock, you can call [`useRealTimers`](https://jestjs.io/docs/jest-object#jestuserealtimers). This function will restore the original implementation of the global Date object.

```JavaScript
describe("after jest 26", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    const mockedDate = new Date(1999, 10, 1);

    jest.useFakeTimers("modern");
    jest.setSystemTime(mockedDate);
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    jest.useRealTimers();
  });

  test("today is November 1st 1999", () => {
    const today = new Date();
    expect(today.toLocaleDateString("en-US")).toBe("11/1/1999");
  });
});
```

## Method 2: spyOn

If your Jest version is older than Jest 26, you can still mock the Date object using Jest [`spyOn`](https://jestjs.io/docs/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname).

```JavaScript
describe("before jest 26", () => {
  let spy;

  beforeEach(() => {
    const mockedDate = new Date(1996, 6, 19);

    spy = jest.spyOn(global, "Date").mockImplementation(() => mockedDate);
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    spy.mockRestore();
  });

  test("today is July 19th 1996", () => {
    const today = new Date();
    expect(today.toLocaleDateString("en-US")).toBe("7/19/1996");
  });
});
```
