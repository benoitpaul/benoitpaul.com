Embarking on the journey of deploying a Remix application often leads developers to consider the vast landscape of hosting solutions.

While Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a plethora of architectural options, we're here to advocate for a smarter, more efficient approach: leveraging the power of AWS with the Cloud Development Kit (CDK).

In this comprehensive guide, we'll dive into the intricacies of deploying a Remix application on AWS, not through traditional means, but through the elegant abstraction provided by CDK.

This innovative approach streamlines the deployment process, empowering developers to harness AWS's capabilities seamlessly while maintaining infrastructure as code.

Let's explore how to marry the prowess of Remix with the agility of CDK to architect a robust and scalable hosting solution.

## Creating the initial project

For this particular tutorial , we'll use the `pnpm` package manager.

Let's create repo with 2 projects:

- the remix demo application
- the CDK infrastruture

```bash

mkdir packages
cd packages
pnpx create-remix@latest
# accept all default options
mkdir infrastructure
cd insfrastructure
pnpx aws-cdk@latest init language=typescript
```

## The demo Remix application

The remix application is super simple: it'll just allow the user to view [pokemon](https://pokeapi.co/) weights, with the routes:

- `/pokemon` to list the pokemon
- `/pokemon/{pokemon name}` to view a particular pokemon weight

```typescript
// routes/pokemon.tsx
import { json } from "@remix-run/node";
import { Link, Outlet, useLoaderData } from "@remix-run/react";
import { getPokemonList } from "~/services/pokemon.server";

export const loader = async () => {
  const pokemonList = await getPokemonList();
  return json({ pokemonList });
};

export default function PokemonPage() {
  const { pokemonList } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Pokemon List</h1>
      <ul>
        {pokemonList.results.map((pokemon) => (
          <li key={pokemon.name}>
            <Link to={`/pokemon/${pokemon.name}`}>{pokemon.name}</Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```typescript
// routes/pokemon.$name.tsx
import { json, type LoaderFunctionArgs } from "@remix-run/node";
import { useLoaderData } from "@remix-run/react";

import { getPokemonByName } from "~/services/pokemon.server";

export const loader = async ({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  const details = await getPokemonByName(params.name!);
  return json({ details });
};

export default function PokemonDetailsPage() {
  const { details } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{details.name}</h2>
      <div>Weight: {details.weight}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Build setup for serverless

In order to get a serverless build, we need to tweak the [`remix.config.js`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/remix-config) file:

```typescript {6,8-9} showLineNumbers
// remix.config.js
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} \*/
export default process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"
  ? {
      ignoredRouteFiles: ["**/._", "**/_.css", "**/*.test.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
      server: "./server.ts",
      assetsBuildDirectory: "public/build",
      serverBuildPath: "server/index.js",
      publicPath: "/_static/build/",
    }
  : {
      ignoredRouteFiles: ["**/*.css"],
    };
```

The following points are important for this configuration:

- We use different configurations, depending on whether the build is meant for production or development
- We define a `server` option, this is important, so we have a server entrypoint to be executed by the lambda.
- The `publicPath` is set to `_static/build/`. This is the path the browser will use to find assets.

Since we have a different configuration for production build, we can add a new script to the Remix project package.json

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "remix build",
    "build:prod": "export NODE_ENV=production; pnpm build",
  },
```

[Remix has a server request handler for AWS](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/other-api/adapter#createrequesthandler), so we'll use that:

```typescript
// server.ts
import { createRequestHandler } from "@remix-run/architect";
import * as build from "@remix-run/dev/server-build";

export const handler = createRequestHandler({
  build: build,
  mode: process.env.NODE_ENV,
});
```

## Onto the infrastructure!

Here is the architecture of this tutorial:

![Diagram of the architecture of a remix application hosted serverless on AWS](/images/remix-hosting-serverless/architecture.svg)

### Storing static assets in an S3 bucket

First, let's create the S3 bucket that will store the public assets:

```typescript
const remixBucket = new s3.Bucket(this, "StaticBucket", {
  publicReadAccess: false,
  blockPublicAccess: s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL,
  removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
  autoDeleteObjects: true,
});
```

### Hosting the server in a lambda and API Gateway

In order to execute the server in AWS, we'll create a lambda and expose it via an API Gateway.

Let's create a construct for that:

```typescript
// remix-server.ts
import * as apigatewayv2 from "@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-alpha";
import * as apigatewayv2_integrations from "@aws-cdk/aws-apigatewayv2-integrations-alpha";
import * as cdk from "aws-cdk-lib";
import * as lambda from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda";
import * as lambda_nodejs from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs";
import * as logs from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-logs";

import { Stack } from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { Construct } from "constructs";

interface RemixServerProps {
  server: string;
}

export class RemixServer extends Construct {
  public readonly apiUrl: string;

  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: RemixServerProps) {
    super(scope, id);

    const lambdaNodejsFn = new lambda_nodejs.NodejsFunction(
      this,
      "RemixLambda",
      {
        runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
        entry: props.server,
        bundling: {
          nodeModules: ["@remix-run/architect"],
        },
        timeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(10),
        logRetention: logs.RetentionDays.THREE_DAYS,
      }
    );

    const lambdaIntegration =
      new apigatewayv2_integrations.HttpLambdaIntegration(
        "LambdaIntegration",
        lambdaNodejsFn
      );

    const httpApi = new apigatewayv2.HttpApi(this, "RemixApi", {
      apiName: scope.node.id,
      defaultIntegration: lambdaIntegration,
    });

    this.apiUrl = `${httpApi.httpApiId}.execute-api.${Stack.of(this).region}.${
      Stack.of(this).urlSuffix
    }`;
  }
}
```

### Cloudfront Distribution

The cloudfront will have 2 origins:

- One origin to serve any calls to the `_static/` routes (S3 bucket)
- One origin to server any other route: the Remix server

Let's create a construct for that as well:

```typescript
// remix-distribution.ts
import * as cloudfront from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront";
import * as cloudfront_origins from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront-origins";
import * as s3 from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3";

import { Construct } from "constructs";

interface RemixDistributionProps {
  bucket: s3.IBucket;
  serverApiUrl: string;
}

export class RemixDistribution extends Construct {
  public readonly distribution: cloudfront.Distribution;
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: RemixDistributionProps) {
    super(scope, id);

    const bucketOriginAccessIdentity = new cloudfront.OriginAccessIdentity(
      this,
      "BucketOriginAccessIdentity"
    );
    props.bucket.grantRead(bucketOriginAccessIdentity);

    this.distribution = new cloudfront.Distribution(this, "Distribution", {
      // certificate: TODO
      // domainNames: TODO
      // httpVersion: HttpVersion.HTTP2_AND_3,
      enableLogging: false,
      defaultBehavior: {
        allowedMethods: cloudfront.AllowedMethods.ALLOW_ALL,
        cachePolicy: cloudfront.CachePolicy.CACHING_DISABLED,
        compress: true,
        origin: new cloudfront_origins.HttpOrigin(props.serverApiUrl),
        originRequestPolicy:
          cloudfront.OriginRequestPolicy.ALL_VIEWER_EXCEPT_HOST_HEADER,
        viewerProtocolPolicy: cloudfront.ViewerProtocolPolicy.REDIRECT_TO_HTTPS,
      },
      // Static assets are retrieved from the /_static path.
      additionalBehaviors: {
        "_static/*": {
          allowedMethods: cloudfront.AllowedMethods.ALLOW_GET_HEAD,
          cachePolicy: cloudfront.CachePolicy.CACHING_OPTIMIZED,
          compress: true,
          origin: new cloudfront_origins.S3Origin(props.bucket, {
            originAccessIdentity: bucketOriginAccessIdentity,
          }),
          viewerProtocolPolicy:
            cloudfront.ViewerProtocolPolicy.REDIRECT_TO_HTTPS,
        },
      },
    });
  }
}
```

### Bucket Deployment

The finishing touch to our infrastructure is to deploy the public assets in the bucket, and invalidate the cloudfront distribution:

```typescript
new s3_deployment.BucketDeployment(this, "RemixBucketDeployment", {
  sources: [s3_deployment.Source.asset(props.publicDir)],
  destinationBucket: remixBucket,
  destinationKeyPrefix: "_static",
  distribution: remixDistribution.distribution,
});
```

### Deploying the app and infrastructure

To deploy the project in our AWS account, we just need to run these commands:

```bash
# build the remix application
pnpm --filter my-remix-app build:prod
pnpx --filter infrastructure aws-cdk deploy
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've explored how to host a Remix application on AWS using CDK.

By leveraging CDK, we can define our infrastructure as code and automate the deployment process, making it easier to manage and scale our applications.

With AWS services like Cloudfront, S3, Lambda, and API Gateway, we can create a reliable and scalable hosting environment for our Remix applications.

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can deploy your Remix application to AWS with confidence, knowing that it's secure, performant, and ready to delight your users.
