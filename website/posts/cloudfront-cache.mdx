[Cloudfront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html) is a DNS provided by AWS that can speed up the delivery of content to your users.

This performance is achieved becaused Cloudfront caches content at [edge locations](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features/?whats-new-cloudfront.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cloudfront.sort-order=desc).

This article discusses how Cloudfront manages its cache policy and TTL.

## Cloudfront architecture

Cloudfront delivers content from an [origin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_Origin.html) (such as an S3 bucket or a website).

When a request is made to Cloudfront for content:

1. If the content is accessed for the first time, this is a _cache miss_: the content is not cached by Cloudfront yet. Cloudfront will fetch the content from the origin.
2. The content is cached by Cloudfront at the edge location.
3. The content is returned to the client.
4. Subsequent accesses to the content via Cloudfront will be returned by its cache. This is a _cache hit_: Cloudfront will not request the content from the origin.

### Cache expiration

Once the content is cache by Cloudfront, what the it is changed _at the origin_? Won't Cloudfront will continue to serve the out-of-date (cached) content?

Well, yes it will... until the cache expires.

The cache policy expiration is set at the [behavior](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_CacheBehavior.html) level. This is the **default TTL** setting. By default it is set to 86,400 seconds (24 hours).

This means that once the content is cached, it will be _stale_ after 24 hours.

When the content is requested again by the client, Cloudfront with query the origin for the content.

- If the content has not changed at the origin, the origin will return a `304 Not Modified` response to Cloudfront
- If the content is changed at the origin, the origin will return a `200 OK` response to Cloudfront, along with the latest version of the content.

## Different cache controls per content

What if you want to use the default cache TTL for most the content but have a different cache TTL for a specific file?

If the origin is an S3 bucket, you can set the `Cache-Control` metadata with a `max-age` value in seconds.

### Example with a CDK project

Here is an example to setup this infrastructure in CDK:

```ts
// create the bucket
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, "Bucket", {
  autoDeleteObjects: true,
  removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
});

// add file to bucket WITHOUT custom cache policy
new s3deploy.BucketDeployment(this, "DefaultCacheBucketDeployment", {
  sources: [
    s3deploy.Source.asset("./assets", {
      exclude: ["*", "!default-cache-image.jpg"],
    }),
  ],
  destinationBucket: bucket,
});

// add file to bucket WITH custom cache policy of 60 seconds
new s3deploy.BucketDeployment(this, "CustomCacheBucketDeployment", {
  sources: [
    s3deploy.Source.asset("./assets", {
      exclude: ["*", "!custom-cache-image.jpg"],
    }),
  ],
  cacheControl: [s3deploy.CacheControl.maxAge(cdk.Duration.minutes(1))],
  destinationBucket: bucket,
});

// create cloudfront distribution
new cloudfront.Distribution(this, "CloudfrontDistribution", {
  defaultBehavior: {
    origin: new origin.S3Origin(bucket),
  },
});
```

In this example, a bucket is created and 2 objects are added:

- default-cache-image.jpg (default cache TTL provided by the Cloudfront behavior)
- custom-cache-image-jpg (custom Cache-Control with max-age to 60 seconds)

This is the code that sets the `Cache-Control` setting:

```ts
cacheControl: [s3deploy.CacheControl.maxAge(cdk.Duration.minutes(1))];
```

#### Testing Cloudfront from the browser

You can inspect the hit cache or miss cache from Cloudfront with the **x-cache** response header.

When requesting default-cache-image.jpg from the browser, I got the following results:

1. First request to the file, the x-cache is `Miss from Cloudfront` (file was not in the cache)
2. Second request to the file, the x-cache is `Hit from Cloudfront` (file is in the cache)
3. Third request to the file (after 60 seconds), the x-cache is `Hit from Cloudfront` (file is still in the cache)

When requesting custom-cache-image.jpg from the browser, I got the following results:

1. First request to the file, the x-cache is `Miss from Cloudfront` (file was not in the cache)
2. Second request to the file, the x-cache is `Hit from Cloudfront` (file is in the cache)
3. Third request to the file (after 60 seconds), the x-cache is `RefreshHit from Cloudfront`

Notice how after 60 seconds the the x-cache is `RefreshHit from Cloudfront` for custom-cache-image.jpg (vs `Hit from Cloudfront` for default-cache-image.jpg).

This means that the cached file was stale. Cloudfront then requested the file from the origin (S3) and got a `304 Not Modified` response (since the file was not modified in the bucket).

As usual, the [github repository](https://github.com/benoitpaul/aws-labs/tree/main/aws-cloudfront-cache) for this example is available.
