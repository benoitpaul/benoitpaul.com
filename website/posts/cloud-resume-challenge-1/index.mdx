# Cloud resume challenge - part 1

The [cloud resume challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) is a great option to start learning the cloud.

I want to learn AWS, so I thought I'd give it a try and the experience has been a blast! This is the first article of a series that will delve into my learnings during this challenge.

The first step of the challenge is to create a simple resume in CSS and HTML, host it on S3, serve it via Cloudfront and finally provide a friendly URL with Route53.

While it's challenging enough for a first step, I opted to spice things up a bit :)

Here is my version:

- Build my whole [website](https://www.benoitpaul.com), including my [resume](https://www.benoitpaul.com/cv/)
- Build the infrastructure as code with CDK
- Setup a simple pipeline for CI/CD

## Getting started

It's considered best practice that [infrastructure and runtime code live in the same package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/best-practices.html), so I created my repository with two folder:

- website
- infrastructure

I have a few requirements for my website:

- redirect all http to https
- the _canonical domain_ is www. In a nutshell: redirect the non-www domain to the www domain.
- clean urls, no \*.html extension. For example, the resume url is https://www.benoitpaul.com/cv, not https://www.benoitpaul.com/cv.html

## Frontend: nextjs

Since I need a complete website and a blog, I'll create the website with Next.js.

For now a static website will do the trick. There's no official support for image optimization at build time, so I'll just need to it turn off

```
const nextConfig = {
  ...
  experimental: {
    images: {
      unoptimized: true,
    },
  },
};
```

## Infrastructure as Code

To get started quickly, I first created an infrastructure with the AWS management console.

There are plenty of tutorials and YouTube videos about this, so that went well. I was able to host a simple html page in no time.

Next step, let's do it with code!

### CDK

The simplest choice for me to create an infrastructure as code is to use the CDK. As a frontend developer I'm familiar with TypeScript, and it's a first class language for the CDK.

I created my own construct to abstract all the details. You can find it [here](https://github.com/benoitpaul/benoitpaul.com/blob/main/infrastructure/lib/website.ts).

There are a few things I learned along the way.

### Domain and certificate

I had purchased my domain at Namecheap, so I created my Hosted Zone manually and copied the NS records in Namecheap.

### Public buckets

My first version used private buckets and an origin access identity for Cloudfront to access the buckets, but that prevented to [use the bucket as a website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html).

With the bucket website option turned off, I would have needed to forget the clean url, but really, who wants to use \*.html extensions?

An option would be to upload the HTML files without an extension and make sure to set the `content-type` to `text/html`, but that's too hacky for me. AWS provides a website option for buckets, so let's use it!

All things considered, it's OK for my buckets to be public as there's no private information. If necessary, you can still [use the website endpoint as the origin, with access restricted by a Referer header](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-serve-static-website/).

With that in place, the last thing I needed to get the clean url was to set the [trailing slash](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/trailing-slash) option in NextJs

```
const nextConfig = {
  ...
  trailingSlash: true,
};
```

### Redirecting non-www to www

To get the non-www redirecting to the canonical www domain, I had to create:

- two buckets
- two cloudfront distributions
- 2 sets of AA and AAAA records

The canonical bucket - **www.benoitpaul.com** is set as a website with the index set to index.html.
The naked domain bucket - **benoitpaul.com** is also set as a website, but with the redirect to www.benoitpaul.com

Then I set a cloudfront distribution for each bucket. Since the buckets are defined as websites, the CDK takes care of setting the cloudfront origin to the bucket [website endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteEndpoints.html) (instead of the REST endpoint)

Lastly, the AA and AAAA records are created for each cloudfront distribution

## Pipeline as Code

The pipeline is gonna be super simple. It will be will triggered when there is a code change in the `main` branch.

There are two constructs we can use to create a pipeline:

- [aws-cdk-lib.aws_codepipeline.Pipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_codepipeline.Pipeline.html)
- [aws-cdk-lib.pipelines.CodePipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.pipelines.CodePipeline.html)

In the end, I could have built the pipeline with either construct, but I opted for [aws-cdk-lib.pipelines.CodePipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.pipelines.CodePipeline.html)
since the AWS describes it as an _opiniated construct library_, and to give it a try first.

I created a [stack dedicated to the pipeline](https://github.com/benoitpaul/benoitpaul.com/blob/main/infrastructure/lib/benoitpaul-pipeline-stack.ts), and defined the the three steps that made it up.

### Step 1: get the source code

Since my code is in GitHub, and I want to trigger the pipeline when there is a change to the `main` branch, I create a [connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/connections-create-github.html) to my repo, manually in the AWS management console

### Step 2: build the code

When I create the pipeline, I set the `synth` property to a new [ShellStep](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.pipelines.ShellStep.html), and define the build steps.

It's as simple as navigating into the website directory, building the Next.js app, then navigating to the infrastructure and building the CDK app.

### Step 3: deploying to production

The last step is to deploy to production. I added a stage to the pipeline to deploy the stack that was synthetized.

## Conclusion

At the end of this chunk of the challenge, I have a complete website hosted on AWS, available with my domain name.
