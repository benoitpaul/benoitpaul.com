DynamoDB streams can be used to aggregate data by using an AWS Lambda function to process the stream records and perform the necessary calculations.

In this tutorial, we will follow the scenario outline in this [article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/dynamodb-streams-use-cases-and-design-patterns/).

Imagine a table of invoices, with each invoice consisting of multiple transactions with different amounts.
Whenever a new transaction is added to an invoice we want to calculate its total amount.

Here is how it's going to work:

1. Create an `InvoiceTransactions` table to store the invoices and their transactions
2. Make sure to enable the DynamoDB Streams on the `InvoiceTransactions` table.
3. Create new table `InvoiceTotal` to store the total amount for each invoice
4. Whenever a new transaction is added to an invoice, it will be recorded by the DynamoDB stream
5. A lambda will be triggered by the stream and update the `InvoiceTotal` table with the new total amount.

## Creating the system

### Create the InvoiceTransactions table

An invoice is made of multiple transactions, and each transaction has an amount and date.

The partition key for this table is the `InvoiceNumber` and the sort is the `TransactionId`.

Here is the CDK code to create the `InvoiceTransactions` table:

```TypeScript
const invoiceTransactionsTable = new dynamodb.Table(
    this,
    "InvoiceTransactions",
    {
        partitionKey: {
            name: "InvoiceNumber",
            type: dynamodb.AttributeType.STRING,
        },
        sortKey: {
            name: "TransactionId",
            type: dynamodb.AttributeType.STRING,
        },
        stream: dynamodb.StreamViewType.NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES,
        billingMode: dynamodb.BillingMode.PAY_PER_REQUEST,
        removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
    }
);
```

<SideNote>

Notice that we set the `stream` property on the table. This will enable the DynamoDB stream on the table.

When filled up, the `InvoiceTransactions` table will look like this:

| Partition Key | Sort Key       | Attribute 1 | Attribute 2 |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| InvoiceNumber | TransactionId  | Amount      | InvoiceDate |
| 1212121       | Client1_trans1 | $100        | 06062016    |
| 1212121       | Client1_trans2 | $500        | 06062016    |
| 1212122       | Client2_trans1 | $200        | 06062016    |
| 1212121       | Client2_trans1 | $500        | 06062016    |

### Create the InvoiceTotal table

The `InvoiceTotal` table will store the aggregated total amount for each invoice.

Here is the CDK code for the `InvoiceTotal` table:

```TypeScript
const invoiceTotalTable = new dynamodb.Table(this, "InvoiceTotal", {
    partitionKey: {
        name: "InvoiceNumber",
        type: dynamodb.AttributeType.STRING,
    },
    billingMode: dynamodb.BillingMode.PAY_PER_REQUEST,
    removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
});
```

When filled up, the `InvoiceTotal` table will look like this:

| InvoiceNumber | Total | UpdateDate |
| ------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| 1212121       | 600   | 06062016   |

### Create the lambda to calculate the total amount

Now let's create the lambda that'll update the total amount for each invoice:

```TypeScript
const updateInvoiceTotal = new nodejs.NodejsFunction(
    this,
    `UpdateInvoiceTotal`,
    {
        entry: join(__dirname, "..", "functions", "update-invoice-total.ts"),
        handler: "handler",
        logRetention: logs.RetentionDays.ONE_DAY,
        environment: {
            INVOICE_TOTAL_TABLE: invoiceTotalTable.tableName,
        },
    }
);

invoiceTransactionsTable.grantStreamRead(updateInvoiceTotal);
invoiceTotalTable.grantWriteData(updateInvoiceTotal);
```

Since the lambda will write to the `InvoiceTotal` table, we pass table name as an environment variable.
We also need to set the permissions for the lambda to write to this table.

For the lambda to use the data stream we also need to set the correct permissions on the `InvoiceTransactions` table with the `grantStreamRead` method.

The `grantStreamRead` allows for the following permissions on the table:

- [dynamodb:DescribeStream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_streams_DescribeStream.html)
- [dynamodb:GetRecords](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_streams_GetRecords.html)
- [dynamodb:GetShardIterator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_streams_GetShardIterator.html)
- [dynamodb:ListStreams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_streams_ListStreams.html)

The following code will make sure that the lambda is triggered by the DynamoDB stream:

```TypeScript
updateInvoiceTotal.addEventSource(
    new lambdaEventSources.DynamoEventSource(invoiceTransactionsTable, {
        startingPosition: lambda.StartingPosition.LATEST,
    })
);
```

Here is the code for the lambda itself:

```TypeScript
import { DynamoDBStreamHandler } from "aws-lambda";
import {
  AttributeValue,
  DynamoDBClient,
  ReturnValue,
} from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";
import { DynamoDBDocumentClient, UpdateCommand } from "@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb";
import { unmarshall } from "@aws-sdk/util-dynamodb";

const client = new DynamoDBClient({});
const ddbDocClient = DynamoDBDocumentClient.from(client);

const { INVOICE_TOTAL_TABLE } = process.env;

export const handler: DynamoDBStreamHandler = async (event) => {
  for (const record of event.Records) {
    if (record.dynamodb && record.dynamodb.NewImage) {
      const newImage = unmarshall(
        record.dynamodb.NewImage as { [key: string]: AttributeValue }
      );

      await ddbDocClient.send(
        new UpdateCommand({
          TableName: INVOICE_TOTAL_TABLE,
          Key: { InvoiceNumber: newImage["InvoiceNumber"] },
          UpdateExpression: `SET #Total = if_not_exists(#Total, :initial) + :num, #UpdateDate = :date`,
          ExpressionAttributeNames: {
            "#Total": "Total",
            "#UpdateDate": "UpdateDate",
          },
          ExpressionAttributeValues: {
            ":num": newImage["Amount"],
            ":initial": 0,
            ":date": newImage["InvoiceDate"],
          },
          ReturnValues: ReturnValue.UPDATED_NEW,
        })
      );
    }
  }
};
```

We're using the TypeScript types from `@types/aws-lambda` to help us with type-safety :)

Since the lambda is triggered by a DynamoDB stream, we define the handler function as a [`DynamoDBStreamHandler`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/f11b860a1da2bd626c7af9dff8a979c2dc1a730f/types/aws-lambda/trigger/dynamodb-stream.d.ts#L4), so we can except an event of type [`DynamoDBStreamEvent`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/f11b860a1da2bd626c7af9dff8a979c2dc1a730f/types/aws-lambda/trigger/dynamodb-stream.d.ts#L44).
We loop through each record, and if there is a `NewImage` on the stream record, we update the `InvoiceTotal` table with the new amount.

It's easier to [unmarshall](https://www.benoitpaul.com/blog/aws/dynamodb-streams-unmarshall/) the DynamoDB record, so we can use JavaScript objects.

## Testing the system

Let's test the scenario by adding some items to the `InvoiceTransactions` table:

```bash
aws dynamodb put-item \
    --table-name InvoiceTransactions \
    --item '{
      "InvoiceNumber": { "S": "ABC" },
      "TransactionId": { "S": "123" },
      "Amount": { "N": "100" },
      "InvoiceDate": { "S": "06062016" }
    }
  }'

aws dynamodb put-item \
    --table-name InvoiceTransactions \
    --item '{
      "InvoiceNumber": { "S": "ABC" },
      "TransactionId": { "S": "456" },
      "Amount": { "N": "300" },
      "InvoiceDate": { "S": "06062016" }
    }
  }'
```

We're adding two transactions ($100 and $300) for the same invoice.

After adding the two items, the `InvoiceTransactions` table contains the two transactions:

InvoiceTransactions:

| InvoiceNumber | TransactionId | Amount | InvoiceDate |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| ABC           | 123           | $100   | 06062016    |
| ABC           | 456           | $300   | 06062016    |

As expected, the `InvoiceTotal` table contains the total amount of $400 ($100 + $300) for the invoice:

| InvoiceNumber | Total | UpdateDate |
| ------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| ABC           | 400   | 06062016   |

## Conclusion

In conclusion, DynamoDB streams and AWS Lambda provide a powerful combination for aggregating data in real-time.
By using DynamoDB streams to capture data changes and an AWS Lambda function to process those changes, developers can easily perform calculations and store aggregate data.
